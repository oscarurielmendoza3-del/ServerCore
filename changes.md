          pubKey: 'public.pem',
          privKey: 'private.pem'
          port: 443
        }
      });
      // example 2
      const server = new ServerCore();
      server.config.port = 80;
      server.config.host = 'localhost';
      server.config.ssl = {
        pubKey: 'public.pem',
        privKey: 'private.pem'
        port: 443

    ```text
    // from
    $(name) { the key is $key with value $value }
    $(name, customKeyName, customValueName) { the key is $customKeyName with value $customValueName }
    // to
    $(name) { the key is %key% with value %value% }
    $(name, customKeyName, customValueName) { the key is %customKeyName% with value %customValueName% }
    ```
  - **(Utilities)**: Added the functions `loadEnv`, `flattenObject`, and `sleep`.
  - **(Utilities)**: Modified the `flattenObject` function to retain null and undefined values and provide better typing.

  - **(Request)**: The `GET` attribute is now `searchParams`.
  - **(Request)**: Request body processing has been delegated to `BodyParser.ts`.
  - **(Request)**: The type of search param is no longer a `Map`, but an object `{ [key: string]: string | undefined }`.
